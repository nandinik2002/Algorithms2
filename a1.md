# Implementation Details:

## **countWords method:** This method counts the number of unique words formed by the characters in the Boggle Board that are also in the dictionary that we are using. I used DFS with backtracking to explore all combinations. I used a HashSet to keep track of the valid words so that there is no repetition. I also used a 2D array to keep track of the visited cells so there was no going back to a cell we had already visited. I also created a helper method for countWords that is uses recursion and the DFS method to visit each cell of the Boggle Board.

**countWordsOfCertainLength:** This method counts the number of words in the Boggle Board of a specified length. Just like the countWords method, I created a recursive helper method which uses DFS with an additional parameter which tracks the length of the word until it reaches the specified length. 

**isWordInDictionary:** This method is simple. I used the searchPrefix method from the DictInterface interface to return true if the word is found in our dictionary file.

**isWordInBoard:** This method takes in the word the user inputs and searches the board for that word. I created a recursive helper method named checkWordHelper which works through the board looking for the specified word. I made sure to set the specified word to all upper case because an issue I ran into is the method not finding the word in the board when it was there. I debugged and realized the board has all capital letters so updating the typed word to all upper case fixed the issue. 

**anyWord:** This method finds any valid word in the board that also exists in the dictionary. I created a recursive helper method named dfsFindAnyWord. This helper method creates a 2D array of all the possible directions and uses this array to move through the board. This helper method also uses Backtracking.

**markWordInBoard:** This method marks the path of a given word on the board. This method uses an ArrayList to return the path. I created a recursive helper method named dfsMarkWordInBoard which contains 3 base cases for if the word is found, if the current position is out of bounds, or if the current position was already visited. I created a 2D array for keeping track of the already visited cells. However, the way I wrote this method doesn’t work correctly, and instead returns null as the path of a given word. I did use print statements to see where exactly the problem was in the markWordInBoard method, but I was still unable to fix it.

**checkTiles:** This method checks if a given list of tiles correspond to a word in the board. I had also created a helper method for this method to check if the tiles are adjacent to each other. I subtracted the current tile’s position from the previous tile’s position to see if that different is 1 to prove they are adjacent tiles. Although my method does not work I believe the logic is correct. 

**anyWord:** This method is similar to the other anyWord method, but instead returns a word of a specified length. I used DFS and backtracking in the helper method, dfsFindAnyWordOfLength, to recursively move through the board, similar to the other helper methods I wrote. Although this method does not work correctly for me, I attempted to fix the errors by adding print statements to figure out where exactly the problem is but was still unable to fix the errors.


#Asymptomatic Analysis: 

**countWords:** The worst case run time would be O(N^8 * M * P^2). N would be the length of the word, and since for each letter we could be searching up to 8 tiles the worst case run time for those loops are N^8. M stands for the dictionary look up time since its linear. P^2 stands for the size of the board’s dimensions.

**countWordsOfCertainLength:** Worst case run time for this method would be O(P^2 * N^8). This is similar to countWords but is more limited since there is a single length we are looking for.

**isWordInDictionary:** Worst case run time for this method would just be linear O(M) since all this method does is search if a certain word is in the dictionary file.

**isWordInBoard:** Worst case run time would be O(N^8 * P^2) because similar to countWordsOfCertainLength, we would max do 8 DFS searches for each letter of a N length word.

**anyWord:** This method’s worst case run time is similar to countWords, O(N^8 * M * P^2). This is because the function of this method is very similar to countWords.

**markWordInBoard:** Worst case run time for this method would be O(N^8 * P^2). This method has the same function as isWordInBoard, but we are now marking the path of how the word is formed.

**checkTiles:** Worst case run time is O(W).

**anyWord:** Worst case run time is O(N^8 * P^2). This method does a DFS method for each letter and the max number of time for each letter N is 8.
