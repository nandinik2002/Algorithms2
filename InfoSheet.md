Does your program run without errors?: no

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your
program run correctly?:

My program is running correctly with the isWordInDictionary method and the isWordInBoard. However, the errors begin in rest of the methods. In the countWords method it is running but is somehow counting the number of words in the board incorrectly. The number I get seems to always be larger than the actual number of words in the board. The countWordsOfCertainLength method is also having the same issue. It is incorrectly displaying the number of words of that certain length in the board. Both of my anyWord methods are also working incorrectly as they return null every time it is run. markWordInBoard is working incorrectly because when called, no tiles are outputted when there are supposed to be valid tiles. Lastly, checkTiles isn't working correctly either as it only has been returning false.
